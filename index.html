				<h2>A few words from the team:</h3>
				<h3>Impact:</h3>
				<p>Generally speaking it is hard to find a hard working reliable worker who lives close by, to complete a small task such as Gardening or Plumbing etc. Our app makes this process simple by showing all candidates in your local area, and you are able to access them without the hassle of a lengthy sign up process like those of current job sites. People can put their skills on their job profile and others who are in need of  their skills can easily contact them via Job Matcher, so our app can be used by anyone. Job Matcher will also help locals who are unemployed get part time work, so our app helps the community as well as the economy.</p>
				<h3>Scalability and Market Fit:</h3>
				<p>Job Matcher works as an on going product because the more people that use it, the more job listings there are and thus the more useful the app is. </p>
				<p>We can create a company around it as we can make some jobs feature on the top of people's lists so that they are more likely to apply for those jobâ€™s. We can possibly charge people to post "featured" jobs. We could also add advertisements to the app.</p>
				<p>The apps main purpose is to be used by local communities, and since there are communities all over the country our app can be useful at a national level.</p>
				<h3>Distributability:</h3>
				<p>If our app is as useful and beneficial to locals as we hope it will be, then it will spread through word of mouth throughout the community, and eventually one community will spread it to another community through social media, such as Facebook, Twitter etc. We can also create our own Facebook, Twitter pages to reach out.</p>
				<p>Job Matcher is an app so it will be available worldwide so it is definitely distributable. The whole base of the app relies on other people posting their jobs so users would want as many people using it as possible so they're more likely to find a job. Therefore it's in the best interest of users to advertise the app to as many people as possible - this means it has virality.</p>
				<h3>Originality:</h3>
				<p>Our app is very simple for the Lehman to use (easy swipe interface, no registration hassles, don't collect emails so no fear of spamming them), it is a new experience for people to find local jobs. Of course there are other job sites, however Job Matcher is original because of its unique and easy to use interface.</p>
